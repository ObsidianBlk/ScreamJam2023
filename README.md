# Corner Store

That corner store has been vacant for nearly as long as anymore can remember. Part of one of the oldest buildings in the neighborhood, someone has purchased it after all this time. They even put out an ad looking for someone willing to clean the place up... overnight.

And here you are, at the threshold, having taken the job.
